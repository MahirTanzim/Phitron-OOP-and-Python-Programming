"""
    Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
    The class which inherits the properties of another class is called the derived class (child class).
"""

"""
Mltil level inheritance:
    In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.
    The derived class of one class becomes the base class for the next class.
    For example, if class A is the base class and class B is the derived class,
    then class C can be derived from class B.
